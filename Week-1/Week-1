## Assignment 1.1

When an user enters an url in the browser, the url is in the form of commonly used language patterns which we may remember or be familiar with. This url is a kind of alias to the target html resource and the relation between the alias (as entered by the user) and the target html resource is resolved by Domain Name Server. So the browser sends the url entered by user to a Domain Name Server (DNS). DNS sends back the response in the form of an IP address as the destination location. The browser then sends this request for the webpage/resource to the destination IP address.When a webpage or a response for the browser's request for resource arrives, the rendering engine renders the UI. Rendering engine has main tasks as Parsing, Tree structure for creating the Document Object model, making the Layout for UI and rendering with exact colours these rendered layout objects. The parsing step breaks the webpage into the smallest units or tags called tokens. These tokens are then used to create and render the tree model popularly known as Document Object Model (DOM) tree. While the DOM tree is being rendered, the render tree is also constructed. Render tree is the visual tree representing the order in which the layout of the objects over the UI. Following this stage the browser does the layout of the elements where size and position of each element is calculated and the layout of the elements are made. Finally each element is rendered paint as per the designed page.
